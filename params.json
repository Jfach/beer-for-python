{"name":"Beer, for Python","tagline":"by Jordan Facibene","body":"\r\nPyBeer is my solution to BeerAdvocate.com's lack of any sort of API. BeerAdvocate is a great resource, and has tons of quality data on a large variety of beers. Right now PyBeer utilizes mechanize, but most likely will not in the near future. This project is still in development, and while it is usable, should in no way shape or form be considered a completed package. \r\n\r\n# Example Usage\r\n\r\nJust make an instance of the Beer class and pass in the name of a beer as a string, and __init__ will gather the data for your beer. All you need to do is access the values:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pybeer import pybeer\r\n\r\nmy_beer = pybeer.Beer('corona extra')\r\n\r\nmy_beer.name # name of the beer, which you set above\r\nmy_beer.brewer # the brewer of the beer\r\nmy_beer.style # the type/style this beer is considered\r\nmy_beer.abv # the ABV (alcohol by volume)\r\nmy_beer.score # average score on BA, averaged from thousands of users\r\nmy_beer.description # commercial description\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nWritten in python 2.7, not yet tested on 3+ but it should work.\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install pybeer==0.1.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
