{"name":"Beer, for Python","tagline":"by Jordan Facibene","body":"\r\nPyBeer is my solution to BeerAdvocate.com's lack of any sort of API. BeerAdvocate is a great resource, and has tons of quality data on a large variety of beers. This project is still in development, and while it is usable, should in no way shape or form be considered a completed package. \r\n\r\n# Example Usage\r\n\r\nJust make an instance of the Beer class and pass in the name of a beer as a string, and __init__ will gather the data for your beer. All you need to do is access the values:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pybeer import pybeer\r\n\r\nmy_beer = pybeer.Beer('corona extra')\r\n\r\nmy_beer.name # name of the beer, which you set above\r\nmy_beer.brewer # the brewer of the beer\r\nmy_beer.style # the type/style this beer is considered\r\nmy_beer.abv # the ABV (alcohol by volume)\r\nmy_beer.score # average score on BA, averaged from thousands of users\r\nmy_beer.description # commercial description\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nSince mechanize is not supported (officially) in Python 3x yet, this will not work in 3x.\r\n\r\n```\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, you can use pip. However this is not the latest version!\r\n```\r\npip install pybeer==0.1.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
